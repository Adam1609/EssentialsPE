The port version of [Bukkit Essentials](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials/) for [PocketMine-MP Software](http://http://www.pocketmine.net/)

**Note: 
This is a development version, it will no longer work on PocketMine-MP 1.3.12 or lower, this will be exclusive for PocketMine 1.4 or newer.**

### Remember that we will only support PocketMine-MP Beta Builds now
If you are planning to use PocketMine-MP _Dev_ builds keep in mind that EssentialsPE can crash it because it doesn't support _Dev_ API versions
